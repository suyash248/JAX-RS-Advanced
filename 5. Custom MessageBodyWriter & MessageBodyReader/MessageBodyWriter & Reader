MessageBodyWriter - 
	MessageBodyWriter's job is to convert the java object to specific media type(e.g. text/plain, application/json etc.), And write it to response body. Example - 

	@GET
	@Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
	public MyObject test() {
		......
		......
		return new MyObject();
	}

	In this case, There must be a MessageBodyWriter, which converts the 'MyObject' instance to 'text/plain' (i.e. String) media type. And writes it to response body.


MessageBodyReader - 
	MessageBodyReader's job is to read the content sent as request body, And converts it to specific java object. Example -

	@POST
	@Consumes(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
	public void test(MyObject myObject) {
		.......
		.......
	}

	POST request body - 
		"This is my object as String."

	In this case, There must be a MessageBodyReader, which reads the request body(as text/plain i.e. String) and converts it to 'MyObject'.


MessageBodyReaders/Writers v/s ParamConverters-
	MessageBodyReaders/Writers deal with request/response body. While on the other hand ParamConverters deal with request parameters(e.g. PathParam, HeaderParam, QueryParam, CookieParam etc.).
