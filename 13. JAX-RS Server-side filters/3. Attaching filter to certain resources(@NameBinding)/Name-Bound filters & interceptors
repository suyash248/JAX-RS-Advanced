Filters and interceptors can be categorized into following 2 categories - 
	1. Global 		- Applied to all resource methods.
	2. Name-Bound 	- Applied to certain resource methods.

Filters and interceptors can be name-bound. Name binding is a concept that allows to say to a JAX-RS runtime that a specific filter or interceptor will be executed only for a specific resource method. When a filter or an interceptor is limited only to a specific resource method we say that it is name-bound. Filters and interceptors that do not have such a limitation are called global.

Filter or interceptor can be assigned to a resource method using the @NameBinding annotation. The annotation is used as meta annotation for other user implemented annotations that are applied to a providers and resource methods. For example - 

@NameBinding
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
public @interface PoweredBy {
}


@Provider
@PoweredBy
public class PoweredByResponseFilter implements ContainerResponseFilter {
	public void filter(ContainerRequestContext requestContext, ContainerResponseContext responseContext) throws IOException {
		......
		......
	}
}

Now 'PoweredByResponseFilter' will be applied to only those resource methods which are annotated with @PoweredBy.

@GET
@Path("hi")
@PoweredBy
@Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
public String hi() {						
	......
	......
}

Same applied to interceptors as well.
